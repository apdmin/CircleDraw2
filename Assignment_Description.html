<h1>CSC420: Homework 3</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<p>This homework is an upgrade to HW2. It requires you to use the same data model for multiple components, and optimally draw multiple updates per second on a canvas (no flickering).</p>
<p>The canvas in your application should be surrounded by four sliders (one above, one below, one to the left, one to the right). Whenever the user moves a slider, the opposite slider should move as well, thus defining a line perpendicular to the axis of slider motion.</p>
<p>At all times, you should clearly show where the circle will eventually be drawn by painting a crosshairs on the canvas. The crosshairs should move as the user moves the sliders.</p>
<p>When the user clicks on the "Show" button, the crosshairs should disappear, and the circle should replace it. Further motion of the sliders does not produce changes to the canvas until the user clicks "Hide." When that happens, the circle disappears, and the crosshairs is again painted as determined by the current positions of the sliders.</p>
<p>Submit your sources and resources to the Angel dropbox before the deadline.</p>
<p>I'll want you to demonstrate how your homework works after you submit it, too.</p>
<p>All Swing homeworks are <b>individual</b>. Group work is not permitted.</p>
